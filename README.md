## About Clean Architecture
Clean architecture is a software design approach that emphasizes the separation of concerns and the independence of
components within an application. It promotes modular code by enforcing clear boundaries between layers. This
architectural style encourages testable business logic while isolating external dependencies
and implementation details.
